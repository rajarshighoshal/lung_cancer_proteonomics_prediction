# Lung Cancer Proteomics Prediction  

This project is a pre-interview task for a job posting at EMBL-EBI.  

The details of the analysis are provided in the `explore_data.ipynb` and `model_building.ipynb` notebooks.  

### Explore Data  
- Data exploration is primarily conducted in the `explore_data.ipynb` notebook.  

### Model Building  
- Model building, evaluation, and detailed analysis can be found in the `model_building.ipynb` notebook.  

## Running the Notebooks  
- Create a virtual environment with Python 3.11.  
- Install dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
- Execute the notebooks in the following order:  
  1. Run `explore_data.ipynb` to generate the processed data.  
  2. Run `model_building.ipynb` to train and evaluate the model.  
- It is recommended to run the model-building process on specialized hardware, such as an **NVIDIA GPU** or **Apple M-series chips**, for optimal performance.
